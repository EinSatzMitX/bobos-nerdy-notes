There are two main types of interrupts:
- [[Hardware Interrupts]]
- [[Software Interrupts]]

Both of these have in common that a specific event happens, through which the [[CPU]] has to interrupt it's current process and save the current processing state so it can execute code that is designed to deal with the event [[Interrupt Handler]].
