Serial Communication is a way for electronic devices to communicate with each other. It comes in different [[Hardware Protocols]], most commonly used of which are [[UART]], [[SPI]], [[I2C]], ...
[[USB]] and [[PS/2]] are Serial Communication Protocols as well, however they're less suited for [[Embedded Systems]]. 
All of these Protocols are different but they all share one common trait: They are Serial, which means the data is transferred bit by bit after each other and not at the same time on different lines (That would be [[Parallel Communication]]). 
This has the advantage of only needing very few transmission lines, which makes it easier to use in cables but has the drawback of requiring more time to transfer data. 
This is why [[CPU]]s for example use [[Parallel Communication]] and [[USB]] cables are so thin.
