When the [[CPU]] or other Processing Units are running, the execute code instruction by instruction. When writing Code for a game console for example, one might want to handle events like button presses, which can happen any time while the program is running. To immediately handle these button presses (or other events caused by hardware) one must use hardware interrupts, which simply finish whatever instruction the CPU is currently processing and then jump to a specified memory address to execute code which can handle the hardware interrupt. This is often referred to as a [[Interrupt Handler]].
