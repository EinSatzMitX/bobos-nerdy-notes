GPIO stands for General Purpose Input/Output. In the context of [[Microcontrollers]] it is the way for them to communicate with the other devices. It usually comes in the form of Pins (take the [[Raspberry Pi]] as an example), which are exposed and can input and output electrical signals. Often Pins are dedicated to a specific purpose (e.g. [[Serial Communication]]) and they can alter between different functions.
