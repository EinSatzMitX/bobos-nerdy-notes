Linux is a [[Unix]]-based [[Operating System Kernel]], which was developped by [[Linus Torvalds]] in the early 90s as a free and [[Open Source]] alternative to [[Unix]]. Luckily there was the [[GNU]] Project, which is a large [[Open Source]] Software foundation, that provided a lot of useful [[Program]]s, like [[GCC]], [[GNU Make]], or [[GNU Binutils]].
Since it is [[Open Source]], there are a lot of forks called [[Linux Distribution]]s. The most common "Distros" today are:
- [[Debian Linux]]
- [[Ubuntu Linux]], which is based on [[Debian Linux]]
- [[Arch Linux]]
- [[Linux Mint]]
- And many, many more...
Most of these [[Linux Distribution]]s have their own [[Package Manager]] and [[Package Cloud]] containg lots of mostly [[Open Source]] Software packages.
Modern day linux machines usually come with a graphical interface consisting of a [[Display Server]]/[[Compositor]] and either a [[Desktop Environment]] or a [[Window Manager]].

The Linux [[Operating System Kernel]] was written in [[C]] and [[Assembly]] and has adopted [[Rust]] not so long ago. The kernel can be compiled easily with a lot of customization options for various use cases and it supports almost all [[CPU Architectures]] out there.
Linux runs on the majority of devices worldwide, mostly on [[Server]]s and technically on Phones as well, since [[Android]] is based on linux.
