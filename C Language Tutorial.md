#Programming 
**Tutorial for the [[C]]/[[C++]] [[Programming Languages]]**

The [[C]] is used for almost every application on every device, thus it it is probably a smart idea to learn it.

# **Basics**
## Primitive types (a.k.a. Variables)
In [[Programming Languages]], there are [[Variable]]s. You can think of these variables as drawers, which can hold some combination of bits. These [[Variable]]s are stored in [[Memory]] and have an address and size.
Just like most [[Programming Languages]], [[C]] has different kinds of [[Variable]] types, or to what this chapter is talking about: [[Primitive Data Structures]], such as
```C
/* Added in C23 */
bool b; /* 1 Byte of storage, can hold values from 0 to 255 */

char c; /* 1 Byte of storage */
signed char sc; /* 1 Byte of storage, holds values from -128 to 127 */
unsigned char uc; /* 1 Byte of storage, holds values from 0 to 255; usually used when dealing with characters or inputs from devices */

/* short signed integers, varying in size but usually 16 bits or [-32768; 32767] */
short sh;
short int shi;
signed short ssh;
signed short int sshi;

/* short, unsigned integers, varying in size but usually 16 bits or [0; 65535] */
unsigned short ush;
unsigned short int ushi;

/* Basic signed integer types, usually 32 bits [-2^31; 2^31 -1] */
int i;
signed s;
signed int si;

/* Basic unsigned integer types, usually 32 bits [0; 2^32 -1] */
unsigned u;
unsigned int ui;

/* Long signed integer types, usually 64 bits [-2^63; 2^63 - 1] */
long l;
long int li;
signed long sl;
signed long int sli;

/* Long unsigned integer types, usually 64 bits [0; 2^64 - 1] */
unsigned long ul;
unsigned long int uli;

/* Long long signed integer types, usually 64 bits or more */
long long ll;
long long int lli;
signed long long sll;
signed long long int slli;

/* Long long unsigned integer types, usually 64 bits or more */
unsigned long long ull;
unsigned long long int ulli;

/* Real floating-point type, usually referred to as a single-precision floating-point type. Actual properties unspecified (except minimum limits); however, on most systems, this is theÂ IEEE 754 single-precision binary floating-point format(32 bits). This format is required by the optional Annex F "IEC 60559 floating-point arithmetic". */
/* So in simple words, it can represent (an approximation of) any real number*/
float f;

/* double precision floating point type, usually 64 bits */
double d;

/* extended precision floating point type, usually 64 or 128 bits */
long double ld;

```

As some may have noticed, there are no [[String]]s in [[C]] by default, however this does not mean you can't handle blocks of text. String are represented with something called [[Pointer]]s, but more about that later.


Basic examples of using those types:
```C
char c1 = 'a';
char c2 = c1 + 1;
// c2 == 'b'

short s1 = 13;
short s2 = s1 / 4;
// s2 will be floored to the next integer, in this case 3

float f1 = 13.0f // floats are usually indicated with an f at the end, to make the work for the compiler easier
float f2 = f1 / 4.0f;
// f2 = 3.250000

```

As a sum-up to the [[Primitive Data Structures]], we will run this block of code:
```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv){
	int i1 = 1-5; // -4
	printf("%i\n", i1);

	float f1 = 13.0f / 4.0f; // 3.25
	printf("%f\n", f1);

	// return 0 to indicate or program exited successfully
	return 0;
}
```

To be able to run this code, we need to invoke or [[Compiler]], for simplicity sake, let's just run [[GCC]] with these arguments and then execute our [[Program]]:
`gcc -c main.c -o program`
_Supposing your C file was called main.c_
`./program`

We should get an output like this: 
```
[~]$ ./test
-4
3.250000
```



## [[Struct]]s
We can use our already gained knowledge to combine these various data types in so called [[Struct]]s. A structure is simply a collection of various data types, which are the "fields" of a structure. 

```C
struct person {
	char name[20];
	int age;
	int height;
};
```
_Example of a struct called "person"_

To create a variable of this new type, we can use multiple methods, but the first one is the most common

```C
struct person Person = {
	.name = "Albert Einstein     ",
	.age = 76,
	.height = 172,
};
```
_This only works for C99 and higher_

In the older days, it was the Programmers job to make sure all fields of a struct were in order at initialization, but since most things can be compiled with "modern C", this will not be a problem.

```C
struct person Person = {
	"Albert Einstein     ",
	76,
	172,
};
```
_Example for older standards of C_
