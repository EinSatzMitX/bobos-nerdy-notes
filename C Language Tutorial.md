#Programming 
**Tutorial for the [[C]]/[[C++]] [[Programming Languages]]**

The [[C]] is used for almost every application on every device, thus it it is probably a smart idea to learn it.

# **Basics**
Just like most [[Programming Languages]], [[C]] has [[Primitive Data Structures]], such as
```C
/* Added in C23 */
bool b; /* 1 Byte of storage, can hold values from 0 to 255 */

char c; /* 1 Byte of storage */
signed char sc; /* 1 Byte of storage, holds values from -128 to 127 */
unsigned char uc; /* 1 Byte of storage, holds values from 0 to 255; usually used when dealing with characters or inputs from devices */

/* short signed integers, varying in size but usually 16 bits or [-32768; 32767] */
short sh;
short int shi;
signed short ssh;
signed short int sshi;

/* short, unsigned integers, varying in size but usually 16 bits or [0; 65535] */
unsigned short ush;
unsigned short int ushi;

/* Basic signed integer types, usually 32 bits [-2^31; 2^31 -1] */
int i;
signed s;
signed int si;

/* Basic unsigned integer types, usually 32 bits [0; 2^32 -1] */
unsigned u;
unsigned int ui;

/* Long signed integer types, usually 64 bits [-2^63; 2^63 - 1] */
long l;
long int li;
signed long sl;
signed long int sli;

/* Long unsigned integer types, usually 64 bits [0; 2^64 - 1] */
unsigned long ul;
unsigned long int uli;

/* Long long signed integer types, usually 64 bits or more */
long long ll;
long long int lli;
signed long long sll;
signed long long int slli;

/* Long long unsigned integer types, usually 64 bits or more */
unsigned long long ull;
unsigned long long int ulli;

/* Real floating-point type, usually referred to as a single-precision floating-point type. Actual properties unspecified (except minimum limits); however, on most systems, this is theÂ IEEE 754 single-precision binary floating-point format(32 bits). This format is required by the optional Annex F "IEC 60559 floating-point arithmetic". */
/* So in simple words, it can represent (an approximation of) any real number*/
float f;

/* double precision floating point type, usually 64 bits */
double d;

/* extended precision floating point type, usually 64 or 128 bits */
long double ld;

```

As some may have noticed, there are no [[String]]s in [[C]] by default, however this does not mean you can't handle blocks of text. String are represented with something called [[Pointer]]s, but more about that later.


Basic examples of using those types:
```C
char c1 = 'a';
char c2 = c1 + 1;
// c2 == 'b'

short s1 = 13;
short s2 = s1 / 4;
// s2 will be floored to the next integer, in this case 3

float f1 = 13.0f // floats are usually indicated with an f at the end, to make the work for the compiler easier
float f2 = f1 / 4.0f;
// f2 = 3.250000

```

As a sum-up to the [[Primitive Data Structures]], we will run this block of code:
```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv){
	int i1 = 1-5;
	printf("%i\n", i1);

	float f1 = 13.0f / 4.0f;
	printf("%f\n", f1);

	// return 0 to indicate or program exited successfully
	return 0;
}
```
