#Programming 
Embedded Systems is a sub-field of Programming that is dedicated to run code on [[Microcontrollers]], which often have limited resources and no [[Operating System]] (or sometimes [[Linux]] as their [[Operating System Kernel]]). This also means not all [[Programming Languages]] are suited for Embedded Development. The most common ones are [[C]], [[C++]], [[Rust]] or simply plain [[Assembly]]. 
[[Microcontrollers]] come in different [[CPU Architectures]], most common of which are [[ARM]], [[RISC-V]], [[AVR]], etc. The [[Microcontrollers]] themselves often are pre-built, like the [[Arduino]] Series, the various [[Raspberry Pi]] models (If one can still count this as a Microcontroller), the [[ESP32]] as well as the [[STM32]] series, etc.
