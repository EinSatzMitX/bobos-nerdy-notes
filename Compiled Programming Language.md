#Programming
Compiled Porgramming Languages like [[C]], [[C++]], [[Rust]], [[Go]], etc. are a specific kind of [[Programming Languages]], that are compiled to [[Object Code]] and then to a [[Executable]]. Compiled Programming Languages are usually used in more [[Low Level]] Applications, such as [[Operating System]]s or [[Embedded Systems]].
The biggest drawback of compiled Programming Languages is that they have to specify their [[Target Triplet]] at [[Compile Time]] thus making already compiled packages incompatible for other platforms.
Although there are workarounds for this problem, such as [[Steam]]s [[Proton]], which is based on[[Wine]], these solutions are definitely not perfect and sometimes don't work at all.
Another workaround would be [[Interpreted Programming Language]]s. They rely on an [[Interpreter]] that interprets the [[Byte Code]] produced by the [[Compiler]]. 
This helps with platform dependency problems but introduces other disadvantages like worse [[Runtime]]s or having to write an [[Interpreter]] for different platforms.
